Glass is more scratch-resistant than acrylic, and microscope slides come pre-cut to size. \n\nEach bin is made of two parts, the Compartment and the Faceplate. You'll also need:\n- 1x3 Microscope slides: https://amzn.to/3O6qjBO\n- 2mm Repair Tape: https://amzn.to/3M1D9zF\n\nHow to assemble:\n1. Apply two strips of tape to the microscope slides, touching the short edges.\n2. Stick that slide to the faceplate.\n3. Apply two strips of tape down the short sides of the faceplate, over the glass.\n4. Apply a third strip along the bottom. It will curl a little around the bottom.\n5. Slap that crap onto the divider bins. Press hard.\n\nThese are perfect for storing small parts, especially if you plan to stack 'em up. The big window makes it easy to check what's inside and monitor your supply levels.\n\nThe inner surface has a generous scoop to make retrieving parts easy, and the tab fits 12mm label-maker tape.\n\nI've provided a selection of different divider counts, to give you OPTIONS! Because microscope slides are only available in one size, only 2-unit-wide bins are possible.\n\nBrims and support are not required, and these can be printed in any filament with an 0.6mm or smaller nozzle. \n\n**Gridfinity Tips!**\n- All storage blocks are compatible with all baseplates!\n- Most storage blocks are stackable!\n- You can add 6x2mm magnets to the corners!

These work great for nippers, flush cutters, wire strippers, pliers, scissors, crimpers, nibblers, cutters, and punch-down tools.\n\n*These storage blocks are extra-big and tend to curl! Use a brim and ensure good bed adhesion.* \n\n**Nipper Holder**: Holds six tools about 80mm from handle to handle. If the tool is spring-loaded, the undercut will keep it from falling out. This can be mounted sideways to store five tools.\n\n**Stripper Holder**: Holds two wire strippers or other long, slim hand tools up to 18mm thicc. I've prepared two sizes - 200mm is your usual multi-hole wire stripper, and 160mm fits many crimpers and termination tools. Both should fit on most printers.\n\n**Gridfinity Tips!**\n- Use any filament with an 0.6mm or smaller nozzle. \n- All storage blocks are compatible with all baseplates!\n- Most storage blocks are stackable!\n- You can add 6x2mm magnets to the corners! They won't magnetize the contents.\n- You can also use M3 screws in the corners.",
